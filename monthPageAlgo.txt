 Algorithm for generating monthpage
    1) Find out which day of the week the first day of the month is on represented as an int
    (.e.g 0,1,2... for mon, tue, wed)

    2) If first day of month falls on monday, instantiate a new Day object corresponding to first day of
    month

    3) Else, find out last date of previous month, then work backwards to find out first date which 
    appears on month page. Instantiate new Day object according to first date which appears on month page

    4) Increment date object 34 times to generate a total of 35 Day objects and save it

    tldr: find first date which appears on month page, instantiate Day object, then increment 34 times
    to generate 35 day objects in total.


Revised Algorithm
    1) Instantiate a javascript Date object corresponding to the first day of the month
    2) If first day of month falls on monday, instantiate a Day object and increment 34 times.
    3) Else, decrement first day Date object until you reach first sunday of page

 // A collection of 35 Day objects and an associated month
    // day-grid if a 5 x 7 grid of day objects
    // col indices are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
    // row indices are 0,1,2,3,4
    // master indices are 0,1,2,...,32,33,34
